<h2 id="a-namereportingareporting-a-crime"><a name="reporting"></a>Reporting a crime</h2>

<h3 id="telling-the-police">Telling the police</h3>

<p>If a crime is taking place or has just happened, call 999. </p>

<p>If it’s not an emergency, you can call the police on 101, report the crime online or go to your <a href="http://www.police.uk/">local police station</a>.</p>

<h3 id="if-youre-afraid-or-nervous">If you’re afraid or nervous</h3>
<p>The police should listen to you and treat you with respect. They can give you extra protection if you’re threatened in any way. </p>

<p>But if you want to report a crime anonymously, you can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555111 or <a href="https://crimestoppers-uk.org/give-information/give-information-online/">fill in the form online</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-details-of-your-case">The details of your case</h3>
<p>When you report a crime you will be given a crime reference number and contact details for the police officer dealing with your case.</p>

<p>You can ask this officer for updates while the investigation is happening. You’ll need your crime reference number whenever you get in touch.</p>

<h3 id="giving-a-statement">Giving a statement</h3>
<p>You might be asked by the police to give a witness statement. This is your written or video recorded account of what happened. It could be used as evidence in court.</p>

<p>You can also explain how the crime has affected you in a <a href="glossary.html#vps">Victim Personal Statement</a>. If your case goes to trial this statement will be shared with the court. It makes sure your thoughts are heard. You can make your personal statement later but if your case is dealt with quickly, you might miss this chance.</p>

<h3 id="support-after-a-crime">Support after a crime</h3>
<p>Within 2 working days of reporting the crime the police will give your details to a local victim support service. Someone from this service will get in touch to see what help you might need.</p>

<p>If you don’t want this to happen, you should tell the police officer handling your case
If you’re the victim of a sexual offence or domestic violence, or the relative of someone killed as a result of a crime, the police must check with you first</p>

<h2 id="a-namepolice-investigationaduring-the-police-investigation"><a name="police-investigation"></a>During the police investigation</h2>

<p>After you’ve reported a crime, the police will gather evidence during their investigation. This can take a long time depending on how complicated and serious the crime was.</p>

<h3 id="keeping-you-informed">Keeping you informed</h3>
<p>The police will keep you up to date throughout the investigation. You can agree with the police officer in charge of your case how often you would like to hear from them. </p>

<h3 id="keeping-you-safe"> Keeping you safe</h3>
<p>The police or support service might want to see if you need any special help through the investigation. This is called a <a href="glossary.html#needs-assessment">Needs Assessment</a>. They usually do this if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are a victim of a serious crime, like domestic violence, a sexual assault or attempted murder</li>
  <li>are a close relative of someone who has been killed as a result of the crime</li>
  <li>have been threatened, intimidated or bullied</li>
  <li>are vulnerable in any way, eg if you’re under 18 or have a disability</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="privacy">Privacy</h3>
<p>The police might give some information about the crime to news reporters to help with the investigation. They’ll normally ask your permission before they do this.</p>

<p>If you’ve been the victim of a sexual assault or rape, it’s against the law for anyone to publish your name, photo or anything else that could identify you.</p>

<h3 id="the-outcome-of-the-investigation">The outcome of the investigation</h3>
<p>The police will let you know within 5 days if someone is: </p>

<ul>
  <li>arrested</li>
  <li>charged</li>
  <li>set free</li>
  <li>released on bail</li>
  <li>given a caution, reprimand, final warning or penalty noise.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will get this information quicker if you have been the victim of a serious crime, have been repeatedly targeted or are considered vulnerable in any way.</p>

<h3 id="the-decision-to-take-a-case-to-court">The decision to take a case to court</h3>
<p>When the police finish their investigation they can pass the information to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). The CPS will normally decide whether there’s enough evidence to take a case to court.</p>

<p>If the CPS decides to drop or alter your case, you should be told the reasons why within 5 days either by the CPS or the police.</p>

<p>If you’re unhappy with this decision you can ask for it to be reviewed through the <a href="http://www.cps.gov.uk/victims_witnesses/victims_right_to_review/">Victims’ Right to Review scheme</a>. You will usually have 7 days to do this.</p>

<h3 id="will-you-have-to-go-to-court"> Will you have to go to court?</h3>
<p>You won’t have to attend the trial if the defendant pleads guilty.</p>

<p>If the defendant pleads not guilty and you witnessed the crime, you are likely to be called to give evidence. You can ask for extra protection to help you give the best evidence.</p>

<h2 id="a-namegoing-to-courtagoing-to-court"><a name="going-to-court"></a>Going to court</h2>

<p>If your case goes to court the police will pass your details to a Witness Care Officer. They will support you throughout the trial, whether you’re giving evidence or not.</p>

<h3 id="getting-ready-to-go-to-court">Getting ready to go to court</h3>
<p>Your Witness Care Officer will help you get ready to go to court. They will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>let you know the date of the trial and where it will take place</li>
  <li>arrange for you to visit the court before the trail starts, so you know what to expect</li>
  <li>help you attend the trial eg by arranging child care or transport</li>
  <li>arrange for someone to go with you into the courtroom if you need it</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="understanding-what-might-happen">Understanding what might happen</h3>
<p>If you are a witness or the relative of someone killed as a result of the crime, you should be able to meet the CPS prosecutor and find out what might happen at the trial. 
If you’ve given a statement, you can ask the police to see it again before you go to court to refresh your memory.</p>

<h3 id="asking-for-extra-protection-in-the-courtroom">Asking for extra protection in the courtroom</h3>
<p>If you’re giving evidence, the court can take extra steps to protect you. That includes if you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are under 18</li>
  <li>are afraid to give evidence</li>
  <li>have been sexually assaulted</li>
</ul>

<p>These are called Special Measures and could include: </p>

<ul>
  <li>putting screens around the witness box</li>
  <li>giving evidence by live video link so you don’t have to face the suspect or their family</li>
  <li>asking the public to leave the courtroom when you’re giving evidence</li>
</ul>

<p>Talk to your Witness Care Officer if you would like to be considered for this kind of support.</p>

<h3 id="when-the-trial-begins">When the trial begins</h3>
<p>Court staff will let you into the building through a different door to the defendant. You can also ask to be seated away from their friends and family.</p>

<p>if you’re not giving evidence you can watch the trial in court from the start. Just make sure the court staff know you’re there. Otherwise you will have to wait until after you’ve given evidence.</p>

<h3 id="the-verdict-and-sentencing">The verdict and sentencing</h3>
<p>Your Witness Care Officer or the police officer in charge of your case will tell you the outcome of the trial within 1 day of it happening. </p>

<p>They should explain what the verdict and sentence will mean for you. If you have questions they can’t answer, they should put you in touch with the CPS, who will be able to help.</p>

<p>They may refer you to victim services for more help if you need it. </p>

<h3 id="expenses-for-going-to-court"> Expenses for going to court</h3>
<p>If you’ve given evidence at the trial, you will be able to <a href="http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/v_to_z/witnesses_expenses_and_allowances/">claim expenses</a> to cover your travel, food, loss of earnings and child care.</p>

<p>Ask your solicitor or a court official for an expenses form.</p>

<h2 id="a-nameafter-trialaafter-the-trial"><a name="after-trial"></a>After the trial</h2>

<h3 id="if-the-offender-appeals">If the offender appeals</h3>
<p>If the offender is allowed to appeal against the sentence or conviction, your Witness Care Officer will tell you when and where the appeal hearing will take place. They will also tell you what the outcome is. </p>

<p>You will have the chance to submit a new Victim Personal Statement to this hearing, through the police.</p>

<h3 id="unwanted-contact-from-an-offender">Unwanted contact from an offender</h3>

<p>Any unwanted contact from an offender will be treated very seriously.</p>

<p>If you are contacted:</p>

<ul>
  <li>by a prisoner, report them to your Victim Liaison Officer or contact the Victim Helpline on 0845 758 5112</li>
  <li>by a prisoner serving their sentence in the community (known as being ‘on licence’), report them to your Victim Liaison Officer if you have one, the police or your local probation trust [http://www.probationassociation.co.uk/about-us/local-probation-trust-websites.aspx]</li>
  <li>by an offender who is under 18 and being supervised by a Youth Offending Team, report them to that team</li>
</ul>

<p>[text to follow]</p>

<h3 id="keeping-you-informed-1">Keeping you informed</h3>
<p>Even after a verdict, sentencing and an appeal, your case can still change. You should be kept informed, no matter what happens. That could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The offender appeals to the Criminal Cases Review Commission for a review of their sentence, especially if there is new, relevant information</li>
  <li>The Commission will decide whether you need to know about the appeal. Most do not result in a case being referred back to the courts. But if yours does get referred, they will let you know</li>
  <li>The offender commits another serious crime while on probation</li>
  <li>You will be told by the police or your Witness Care Officer, and be given the chance to ask for a Victim Summary Report. This looks back at how the case was managed and if any lessons can be learnt</li>
  <li>The Parole Board are considering whether to release the offender from prison</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="a-namevictims-codeajustice-process-and-the-victims-code"><a name="victims-code"></a>Justice process and the Victims Code</h2>

<p>The information here comes from The Victims' Code.
The Victims' Code tells everyone who works in the justice system how you should be treated. The code starts when you first need support to tell the police about a crime and can end once a person is released from prison. You do not have to remember it, but you can ask about it at any point.</p>
