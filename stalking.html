<p>Individual incidents taken on their own might not seem too serious, such as a rude remark in the street or persistent phone calls, but they can also involve deeply traumatic events – threats of violence, aggression, criminal damage and worse. </p>

<p>What makes the problem particularly hard to cope with is that it can go on over a long period of time, making victims constantly anxious and afraid. Sometimes the problem can build up slowly and it can take a while for the victim to realise that they are caught up in an on-going campaign of abuse. The problem isn't always 'physical' because of the internet and 'cyber-stalking' or online threats can be just as intimidating for the victim. </p>

<p>One of the things that can make it difficult for police and others to deal with harassment and stalking is the 'drip, drip, drip' nature of the incidents. Helping the police and courts to see the bigger picture can make it much easier to deal with the offender's behaviour.</p>

<p>Things you can do, straightaway, if you think you are suffering harassment or stalking include: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Keeping a diary of events. Write down the date, time, location and details of what happened. It's also a good idea to include information about any other witnesses who can confirm what happened. </li>
  <li>Keeping copies of letters, text messages, emails and take screen prints of other online messages (eg on Facebook).</li>
  <li>Trying to get 'evidence' of any events that happen at your home – but be careful to do this discreetly. Waving a camera at someone who is harassing you is unlikely to help and could make things worse.</li>
  <li>Stalking was made a criminal offence in England and Wales in November 2012. Two new offences were introduced – stalking, and stalking where there is a fear of violence. The changes were made under the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012.</li>
</ul>
