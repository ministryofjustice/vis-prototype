<p>Antisocial behaviour (ASB) can take on many forms, some can be legally defined as crimes, others may not be, but they may still have the same kind of effect on you.
Problems that usually get included in the term antisocial behaviour can include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>verbal abuse or threatening behaviour</li>
  <li>vandalism</li>
  <li>graffiti</li>
  <li>noise</li>
  <li>persistent littering</li>
  <li>drunkenness</li>
  <li>'pranks' that get out of hand</li>
</ul>

<p>Lots of other types of 'bad behaviour' can also be considered antisocial, especially if they go on for long periods of time. Individual incidents might not look too serious, but victims can be on the receiving end for months making their life very difficult.</p>

<p>A lot of people and communities suffer from antisocial behaviour and the problem can affect whole streets or neighbourhoods.</p>

<p>Although every case will be different, some victims of antisocial behaviour have described it as a 'living nightmare'. Sometimes the problem can go on for months, even years, and victims find themselves adapting their lifestyle to try and reduce the problem - like staying home more, avoiding public transport or even moving home to get away from it. It can be hard for other people to understand just how bad it feels – they might think that an individual incident doesn't sound too bad, but don't realise that it's just the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p>You could be feeling afraid, not sleeping, worry about your safety or your family's safety, or even feeling angry towards the people who are doing this. Lots of different reactions are quite normal and everyone will react in their own way.</p>
