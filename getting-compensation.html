<ul>
  <li>victim of the crime</li>
  <li>close relative of someone who died because of a crime</li>
  <li>witness of a serious crime</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many ways to get compensation and the most common ones are listed below in order of priority. </p>

<h3 id="insurance">1: Insurance</h3>

<p>The first place to look for compensation is normally insurance policies. These may be your own insurance policies - particularly if you were victim of a property crime such as theft or vandalism. Your insurance company will usually want to know the crime reference number.</p>

<p>You can ask your employer about insurance entitlements. Some employment contracts include insurance that will pay money if someone dies while working or they are badly injured. </p>

<p>If you know the person who committed the crime you may be able to make a claim against their insurance policies. </p>

<p>If you think your employer is at fault for the crime happening then you need to tell the police if you haven't already.</p>

<h3 id="benefits">2: Benefits</h3>

<p>There may also be <a href="https://www.gov.uk/browse/benefits/disability">benefits</a> which you can now get if you have serious injuries from which you can't recover quickly. If a relative has died, there may be other <a href="https://www.gov.uk/browse/benefits/bereavement">bereavement benefits</a> you can claim.</p>

<h3 id="court">3: Court</h3>

<p>If the court decides that someone is guilty of the crime, they may say the person has to pay you money to make up for the crime. This is called a Compensation Order and is decided by the judge as part of the sentence.</p>

<p>In order for the court to know that you need compensation, you should make sure you have completed a <a href="glossary.html#vps">Victim Personal Statement</a>.</p>

<h3 id="compensation-from-government">4: Compensation from Government</h3>

<p>As a last resort you can apply to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/criminal-injuries-compensation-a-guide">Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA)</a>. This is a government fund for victims of crime where you don't know who injured you or they don't have any way to pay. You must apply within two years and you must have cooperated with any police investigation if you want CICA to help. Often the court must have found a person guilty of the crime for you to get compensation.</p>

<p>This process may take a long time. You do not need to have someone represent you.</p>

<h3 id="a-namecompensation-appeala-5-appealing-your-compensation-decision"><a name="compensation-appeal"></a> 5: Appealing your compensation decision</h3>
<p>If you disagree with what your insurer has decided you can apply to the <a href="http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/">Financial Ombudsman</a>.</p>

<p>If you disagree with an employer's decision, you can speak to <a href="http://www.acas.org">ACAS</a> for guidance on how and whether to proceed.</p>

<p>If you disagree about a benefits decision, you can apply to the <a href="https://www.justice.gov.uk/tribunals/sscs">Social Security and Child Support Tribunal</a>.</p>

<p>If you disagree about a court decision, you can appeal - start by speaking to the Crown Prosecution Service laywer or Witness Care Unit. Normally you cannot appeal a guilty verdict in order to ask for a sentence to include compensation.</p>

<p>If you disagree with the CICA decision, you can apply to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/criminal-injuries-compensation-tribunal/overview">First-tier Tribunal (Criminal Injuries Compensation)</a>.</p>
