If you're a victim of crime whlie abroad:

- make notes of what happened and to whom you reported the crime, taking names, police rank and contact numbers; this supports any future insurance claim and helps with any court case where you might be called to give evidence
- contact your bank to put a stop to any lost/stolen credit cards and, if necessary, arrange to receive a cash transfer
- get names and contact details of any medical staff you have contact with
- if your passport or identity papers are stolen, contact the local British consulate as soon as possible

As well as experiencing the impact of the crime itself, you will also have to negotiate and understand the police and judicial systems of the country where the crime occurred. When combined with the experience of having a holiday or business trip disrupted unpleasantly, this can cause significant emotional distress.

Some crimes will have a direct impact on your travel itinerary or plans, for example the theft of credit cards, mobile phone or travel documentation creates further disruption and anxiety, and can lead to difficulties with local payments.

Experiencing physical injury or requiring a forensic examination after an assault or other violence may mean needing to communicate with medical staff in a foreign language, or relying on the presence of an interpreter, at a time of pain and intimate examination.
