title: Special Measures
---

Some victims of crime can find it difficult or scary to talk about what happened to them. The Victims Code means that organisations have agreed to give extra help to these people to make sure they get the best chance of a fair trial.

When you go to the police 

* you should be able to ask to give evidence in a private room if you find it embarrassing
* you can ask for a [Needs Assessment](glossary.html#needs-assessment) to make sure you get special help on further visits.


When the case goes to court the <a href="organisations#wcu">Witness Care Unit</a> will decide whether you need

*  screens in court so that you cannot see the suspect or their family
*  to use a video link from a different room in the court building into the courtroom
*  the judges and lawyers to take off their wigs and gowns
*  the public to leave the court
*  the trial to have no public or newspaper reporters (very serious cases only)
*  someone to help you understand the questions and give your evidence

If a member of your family was killed in the crime 

* you can meet the [Crown Prosecution Service](organisations.html#cps) to tell them you made a Victim Personal Statement and that it is up to date, so that it can be read out in court
* you should be told if the person is found not guilty or they are charged with a crime that isn't so serious
* the CPS should also explain the sentence given.

After the trial

* you can get back money you spent to go to court (expenses)
* if the other person appeals the Witness Care Unit will tell you what is happening.
