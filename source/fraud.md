Fraud is when someone steals property, goods or money by tricking, or trying to trick you.

Fraudsters are criminals who use clever tactics and tricks to manipulate their victims. However you're feeling or whenever the crime took place, you can talk to someone in complete confidence.

Some common words to describe types of fraud include: 'scam', 'con', 'trick', 'sham', 'false representation' 'swindle', 'deceit', and many more.

One common tactic used by fraudsters is to use a false identity to commit crimes.

For example the fraudsters may:

- use fake name badges and identification
- deceive you into buying goods or services that are not for sale, or don't exist
- provide a service, often of poor quality, but charge you many times the original amount quoted, without reason
- trick you into giving them money, even large amounts, possibly over a long period of time
- resort to trying to frighten, bully or harass you to get more money.

##Identity theft

Identity theft is someone committing a crime using your personal details.

This can include deceiving others to open bank accounts, applying for loans, or purchasing goods and services using your bank details and money. It can also extend to 'borrowing' your identity to hide debts or poor credit ratings and, in extreme cases, creating identity documents.

This crime can be extremely damaging, as not only do you feel powerless to stop the crimes being committed, you may not even be aware that it's happening until it is too late.
