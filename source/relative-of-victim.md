## Helping a friend or family member

The police cannot investigate a crime unless it has been officially reported and the victim has made a statement. 

However some support is still available to some victims of crime to help them before the police become involved. The police cannot force a crime to be reported, but will do what they can to help the victim understand how they can do so safely.

The content on this site may help the victim understand the process better. A postcode search on the homepage will tell you how to get help in your area.

## I've been personally affected by a serious crime
If you are the close relative of a victim of the most serious crime then you are still entitled to:

* Emotional support in recovering from the crime - you can get this through the local police.
* To make your own [Victim Personal Statement](/glossary.html#vps) so that the court knows how the crime has affected you. This may make a difference to the sentence, or any conditions on parole.
* [Special measures](special-measures.html) if you need to give evidence in court and are worried about seeing the person who committed the crime
* In some cases you may also get [compensation](compensation.html) if your ability to work is affected.
* Know the punishment the court gives to the person who committed the crime.
* Know when the person who committed the crime is released, and any restrictions.

Search for your local Police and Crime Commissioner's website or helpline on the [homepage](index.html). They will be able to assess your needs and direct you to local services that can help.

## I witnessed the crime
If you saw the serious crime happen but are not a close family member, then the entitlements of the Victims Code may not apply to you. 

Instead the justice process follows the Witness Charter, and it will try to find ways for you to give your evidence to the police and in court safely.

When you speak to the police about the crime then you should also let them know if you are being threatened or wouldn't be comfortable seeing the person who committed the crime in court. They can tell you about what help they can give, before you make a formal statement.

You can also speak to the police or courts if something happens after you have made your statement that makes you worried you couldn't give evidence safely.
