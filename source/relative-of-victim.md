If you are the close relative of a victim of the most serious crime then you are still entitled to:

* Emotional support in recovering from the crime
* [Special measures](special-measures.html) if you need to give evidence in court
* [Compensation](compensation.html) if your ability to work is affected

Search for your local Police and Crime Commissioners' website or helpline on the [homepage](index.html). They will be able to assess your needs and direct you to local services that can help.
