title: Complaining
---

If your problem is with:

* <a href="#signatories">an organisation that has signed up to The Victims Code</a>
* <a href="#local">a charity or helpline that your local police or victims' contact centre have sent you to</a>
* <a href="#website">the content or function of this digital service</a>

##Â <a name="signatories"></a>Problems with Government Services
Under the Victims' Code, you're entitled to be treated by <a href="organisations.html">any of its service organisations</a> (e.g. the police, courts) in a respectful, sensitive and professional manner without discrimination of any kind.

If this doesn't happen, or they don't live up to their other promises under the code, then you're entitled to make a complaint. You can also expect that complaint to be swiftly and fully addressed.

* If you feel comfortable doing so, you should discuss your complaint with the person you've been dealing with.
* If you don't feel comfortable doing so, or aren't happy with how they deal with their complaint, all of the organisations have a complaints procedure and The Victims' Code says you must be given details of who to contact and the process if you request it.
* If you raise the complaint with the wrong organisation, The Victims' Code says they will send the complaint to the right person and tell you they've done it.

You should expect to receive an acknowledgement within ten days of your complaint being received. This will say when you can expect a response. Some organisations will be able to provide a response within the ten days.

The response should also be in a format and language you can understand.

If still not satisfied, you can ask your Member of Parliament to pass your complaint to the [Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman](http://www.ombudsman.org.uk/make-a-complaint).

## <a name="local"></a>Problems with local services
Not all of the local services you can be sent to have signed up to The Victims' Code. If a local organisation hasn't delivered the service you'd expect, you should raise these with the local victims helpline. You can search for this by entering your postcode on the homepage.

Your local police, and your local Police and Crime Commissioner who arranged these services, have signed up to The Victims Code. You can therefore expect your complaint to be taken just as seriously.
