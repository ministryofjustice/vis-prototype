title: Fraud
---

Many people are taken in by fraudsters â€“ criminals that use clever tactics and tricks to try and manipulate their victims. However you're feeling or whenever the crime took place, you can talk to someone from Victim Support in complete confidence.

Fraud is when someone steals property, goods or money by tricking, or trying to trick you.

Some common words to describe types of fraud include: 'scam', 'con', 'trick', 'sham', 'false representation' 'swindle', 'deceit', and many more.

One common tactic used by fraudsters is to use a false identity to commit crimes.

For example:

- They might use fake name badges and identification.
- They might deceive you into buying goods or services that are not for sale, or don't exist.
- They may provide a service, often of poor quality, but charge you many times the original amount quoted, without reason.
- They may trick you into giving them money, even large amounts, possibly over a long period of time.
- They may resort to trying to frighten, bully or harass you to get more money.

Identity theft

Identity theft is specifically when someone commits fraud by using your personal details to commit crime.

This can include deceiving others to open bank accounts, applying for loans, or purchasing goods and services using your bank details and money. It can also extend to 'borrowing' your identity to hide debts or poor credit ratings and, in extreme cases, creating identity documents.

This crime can be extremely damaging, as not only do you feel powerless to stop the crimes being committed, you may not even be aware that it's happening until it is too late.
