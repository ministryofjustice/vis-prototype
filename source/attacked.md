## Assault

Assault is a physical attack or a threat that causes fear of an attack. Victims of assault may be attacked by one or more people. An assault may include one or more types of harm, such as pushing, shoving, slapping, punching, or kicking. It may also include the use of weapons like knives, sticks, bottles, or bats. Common injuries from an assault include bruises, black eyes, cuts, scratches, and broken bones. Victims may even be killed during an assault. Even if the attack results in no physical injury to the victim, it still can be considered an assault.

There are many laws used to classify different kinds of assault. The classification can be based on injury, weapons used, or other circumstances of the crime. Any assault victim, though, injured or not, may experience emotional reactions to the crime.

## Gun crime

Despite the impression given by the media, crime involving guns is actually quite rare in the UK. However, being involved in a gun crime can cause serious shock and distress, even if a gun isn't actually fired, but only used as a threat, it still remains a very serious crime.

Gun crime can include incidents such as:

* Gang attacks, which affect the wider community and can potentially, harm innocent people in the case of mistaken identity.
* Violent theft where weapons, including guns, are used to threaten and intimidate. (People carrying an imitation or banned handgun is still counted as a gun crime even if it can't be used.)
* Witness intimidation.

Experiencing gun crime can be a very shocking experience for anyone. Whether or not anyone is actually hurt, the fact that someone has used a gun to force you to do something can cause a strong reaction – both emotionally and physically.

Everyone will be different in how they respond.

The experience can leave some people feeling numb. Some feel intense anger towards the perpetrator. Some people turn their anger inward and blame themselves for getting into a situation where such a crime could happen. ​

## Knife crime

While the media tend to focus on knife crime around young people and gangs, it can actually involve people of all ages.

Knives can be used in several criminal situations including robbery, rape, sexual assault and domestic violence. Being a victim of knife crime, or witnessing an attack, can be a shocking experience.

As well as the obvious and frightening risk of injury, many people have a complex emotional and behavioural response, whether or not they are physically harmed. This is often because they have been forced to do something against their will.

However, everyone also reacts to crime differently; you might feel surprisingly calm and unaffected, or you could be overcome by shock and fear, and anything in between. You may feel nothing except intense anger towards the perpetrator. It’s also not uncommon to turn your anger inward and blame yourself for getting into a situation where a crime like this could happen.
