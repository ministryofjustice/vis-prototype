## Overview

All victims of crime have a right to information and support from organisations like the police and the courts.

If you are a victim of crime, you are entitled to:

- an assessment to find out what support you need
- extra support if you are a victim of a serious crime
- have your details passed to other organisations that help and support victims of crime in your area
- get information about what to expect
- get information about what the police are doing
- make a Victim Personal Statement about the crime
- ask the Crown Prosecution Service ([CPS](organisations.html#cps)) to look at things again if you are not happy with what they decide
- be told what is happening with the trial and sentence
- get help or support for going to court to give evidence
- know if the person found guilty makes an appeal asking a different court to look at their case again
- apply for compensation
- information about restorative justice
- complain if you do not get the right information and support

## Extra support

For victims of more serious crimes, extra support is available if you are:

- vulnerable or being threatened
- a victim of lots of crimes, for example, stalking
- a victim of rape or other sex offences
- being abused by someone you live with
- a victim of human trafficking
