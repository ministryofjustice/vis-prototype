If you are a victim of crime, you are entitled to:

- an assessment to find out what support you need
- get information about what to expect
- make a [Victim Personal Statement](#vps) about the crime
- <a href="special-measures">extra support</a> if you are a victim of a serious crime, are being threatened, or vulnerable in another way
- information about <a href="glossary.html#restorative-justice">restorative justice</a>
- have your details passed to other organisations that help and support victims of crime in your area
- get information about what the police are doing
- be told what is happening with the trial and sentence
- get help or support for going to court to give evidence
- know if the person found guilty makes an appeal asking a different court to look at their case again
- ask the Crown Prosecution Service ([CPS](organisations.html#cps)) to look at things again if you are not happy with what they decide
- apply for <a href="getting-compensation.html">compensation</a>
- <a href="complaining.html">complain</a> if you do not get the right information and support
