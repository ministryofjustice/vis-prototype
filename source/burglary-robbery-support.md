Burglary and robbery can be distressing at first, but many people find that the process of recovery is fast. 

Once you have reported the robbery to the police, you will be issued with an incident number which you can use to claim against any insurance policies you have.

If the item stolen has a major impact on your life - for example it stops you being able to work or you find that you can't sleep for an extended period of time - then you might want to make a Victim Personal Statement at your police station. If the person is caught, then your statement can be read out in court and may affect the sentence they are given.

### Magistrates Courts and property crimes

Once a crime has enough evidence, it will quickly move to a magistrates court. These courts do not have a jury but are able to deal with less serious crimes and give smaller sentences for the crimes - for example up to six months in prison or a fine of up to Â£5000. 

A lot of property crime - theft, vandalism, burglary - falls into this category.

If the person caught decides to plead guilty to the charges at magistrates court, then there will be no jury trial.

The police may not have time to tell you about the case going to magistrates court before the verdict is decided.

If they plead not guilty, then the case may move to crown court where jury trials happen.
