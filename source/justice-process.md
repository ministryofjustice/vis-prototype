## Overview

The information here is a summary of the full [Code of Practice for Victims of Crime](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-code-of-practice-for-victims-of-crime) (The Victims' Code).

The Victims' Code explains what should happen from when you tell the police about a crime until after the trial.

Support is available at every stage of the process so you understand what is happening and can get answers to your questions.

The Victims' Code explains:

- victims' support services
- who can get support
- your rights: what support victims must get
- support while the police are investigating a crime
- support before the trial
- support during the trial
- support after the trial

## Victims' support services

The services supporting victims of most crimes in England and Wales are provided through your local Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC).

## Who can get support?

Anyone who has suffered physical, mental or emotional harm because of a criminal act can get support.

You can also get support if someone from your family is killed in a crime.

The crime must have happened in England or Wales but you do not need to have lived there when it happened.

## Your rights: What support victims of crime must get

The Victims' Code sets out your rights and what you should expect as a victim of crime. 

## Support while the police are investigating a crime

If you or someone else tells the police about a crime that happens to you, the police must:

- give you information about what is happening and what you should expect from the services involved in law, crime and punishment
- do an assessment to find out what support you need
- decide if you need extra support
- give you the option to have your details shared with other organisations that support victims
- tell you if someone is arrested for the crime

While the police are investigating the crime you can make a victim personal statement (or impact statement for a business) saying how the crime has affected you.

## Support before a trial

The police must tell you if the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided to deal with the case without going to court.

If you have to go to court to give evidence you can get support from the Witness Care Unit. They will make sure you know:

- what to expect in court
- when the case will go to court
- when the trial will be
- if the accused person will be in prison before the trial or on bail
- what to expect if you need to give evidence in court â€“ they can arrange for you to go to the court to look round before you have to give evidence
- if the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decides to make any changes to the charge(s) or if they decide not to take the case to court
- how to ask the CPS to look again at the case if you are not happy with their decision

## Support during the trial

You are allowed to watch the trial in court after you've given your evidence. If you do not have to give evidence you should tell the court you will be there.

If you are a witness giving evidence in court you should be able to:
- meet the prosecutor and ask about the trial 
- wait in a different place from the suspect and their friends or family
- have any special support the court thinks will help you give evidence
- speak to someone who can tell you what will happen at the trial 

## Support after the trial

You can get support from victim services to help you after the trial.

You are also entitled to claim back any money you spent to go to court.

### Appeals
This is when a convicted person asks another court to look at the case again.
The Witness Care Unit must tell you what is happening and if there is a change to the sentence the person was given.
