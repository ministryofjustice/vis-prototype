## Overview

The information here is a summary of the full [Code of Practice for Victims of Crime](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-code-of-practice-for-victims-of-crime) (The Victims' Code).

The Victims' Code explains what should happen from when you tell the police about a crime until after the trial.

Support is available at every stage of the justice process so you understand what is happening and can get answers to your questions.

The Victims' Code explains:

- victims' support services
- who can get support
- your rights: what support victims must get
- support while the police are investigating a crime
- support before the trial
- support during the trial
- support after the trial

There is also extra support for victims of more serious crimes such as:

- rape and other sex offences
- domestic abuse: being abused by someone you live with 
- human trafficking: being brought to this or another country against your will
- terrorism, attempted murder or grevious bodily harm
