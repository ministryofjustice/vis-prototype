title: Hate crime
---

A hate crime occurs when a person is targeted because of hostility or prejudice towards their:

- disability
- race or ethnicity
- religion or belief
- sexual orientation
- transgender identity

This includes a personâ€™s property, as well as the person themselves and a victim does not have to be a member of the group at which the hostility is targeted. In fact, anyone could be a victim of a hate crime.

Being a victim of this kind of crime can be a particularly frightening experience as you have been victimised because of who you are, or who or what your attacker thinks you are.

Hate incidents can feel like crimes to those who suffer them and often escalate to crimes or tension in a community. You can report such incidents, but the police can only prosecute when the law is broken.

Where can hate crime take place?

Hate crime can take place anywhere:

- home
- streets
- work
- schools
- colleges
- sporting events
- social media (ie Facebook, Twitter)

Incidents can include:

- threats

- graffiti
- abusive texts
- distribution of offensive posters and flyers in local communities
offensive voicemails
- offensive social media content on sites such as Facebook and Twitter
