## Providing Information
* Helping you understand the [justice process](justice-process.html)
* Helping you understand the [organisations](organisations.html) involved in the justice process
* Helping you understand the [entitlements](your-rights.html) you have under The Victims' Code - the things you can expect and ask for
* Telling you how you can get [compensation](compensation.html) for a crime
* Telling you [where to complain](complaining.html) if something goes wrong.
