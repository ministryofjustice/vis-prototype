title: Getting compensation
---

You may be eligible for compensation if you are a:

- victim of the crime
- close relative of someone who died because of a crime
- witness of a serious crime

## 1: Insurance

The first place to look for compensation is normally insurance policies. These may be your own insurance policies - particularly if you were victim of a property crime such as theft or vandalism. If you know the person who committed the crime you may be able to make a claim against their insurance policies.

You can ask your employer about damages or insurance entitlements if this is appropriate.

## 2: Benefits

There may also be [benefits](https://www.gov.uk/browse/benefits/disability) which you can now get if you have serious injuries from which you can't recover quickly. If a relative has died, there may be other [bereavement benefits](https://www.gov.uk/browse/benefits/bereavement) you can claim.

## 3: Court

If the court decides that someone is guilty of the crime, they may say the person has to pay you money to make up for the crime. This is called a Compensation Order and is decided by the judge as part of the sentence.

In order for the court to know that you need compensation, you should make sure you have completed a [Victim Personal Statement](/glossary.html#vps).


## 4: Compensation from Government

As a last resort you can apply to the [Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA)](https://www.gov.uk/criminal-injuries-compensation-a-guide). This is a government fund for victims of crime where you don't know who injured you or they don't have any way to pay. You must apply within two years and you must have cooperated with any police investigation if you want CICA to help. Often the court must have found a person guilty of the crime for you to get compensation.

This process may take a long time. You do not need to have someone represent you.

## 5: Appealing your compensation decision
If you disagree with what your insurer has decided you can apply to the [Financial Ombudsman](http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/).

If you disagree with an employer's decision, you can speak to [ACAS](http://www.acas.org) for guidance on how and whether to proceed.

If you disagree about a benefits decision, you can apply to the [Social Security and Child Support Tribunal](https://www.justice.gov.uk/tribunals/sscs).

If you disagree about a court decision, you can appeal - start by speaking to the Crown Prosecution Service laywer or Witness Care Unit. Normally you cannot appeal a guilty verdict in order to ask for a sentence to include compensation.

If you disagree with the CICA decision, you can apply to the [First-tier Tribunal (Criminal Injuries Compensation)](https://www.gov.uk/criminal-injuries-compensation-tribunal/overview).
