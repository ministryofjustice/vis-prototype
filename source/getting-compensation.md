title: Getting compensation
---

You may be eligible for compensation if you were the victim of the crime, a close relative of someone who died because of a crime, or someone who witnessed the most serious types of crime.

The first place to look for compensation is normally insurance policies. These may be your own insurance policies - particularly if you were victim of a property crime such as theft or vandalism. If you know the person who committed the crime you may be able to make a claim against their insurance policies.

You can ask your employer about damages or insurance entitlements if this is appropriate.

There may also be benefits to which you become entitled as a result of serious injuries.

As a last resort you can apply to the [Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA)](https://www.gov.uk/criminal-injuries-compensation-a-guide). This is a government fund for victims of crime where you don't know who injured you or they don't have any way to pay. You must apply within two years and you must have cooperated with any police investigation if you want CICA to help.

This process may take a long time. You do not need to have someone represent you.

If you disagree with the CICA decision, you can apply to the [First-tier Tribunal (Criminal Injuries Compensation)](https://www.gov.uk/criminal-injuries-compensation-tribunal/appeal-to-tribunal).
