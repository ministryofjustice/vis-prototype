title: Support after the crime and getting through the justice process
---

From April 2015, your local Police and Crime Commissioner is responsible for arranging the support you need if you've been a victim of crime. Rather than lots of national helplines, support is organised based on the needs of your community.

If you speak to the police, they should conduct a [needs assessment](/glossary.html#needs-assessment) to work out what help you will need to recover from the crime. If your case goes to a trial, they will also make sure that the courts know about any [special help](/special-measures.html) you might need.

Your local police have also made arrangements for you to get support if you haven't gone to the police or change your mind later. Many have set up telephone helplines which can work out which charities can help you, and lots have websites that can help too.

Search for your local services by entering your home postcode, and you'll get the contact details. We also provide details for a few national helplines for very specific types of crimes. If you're not sure whether these apply to you, contact your local service and they can refer you onwards.
