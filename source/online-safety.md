title: Online safety
---

The safest way to find information on the Internet is to go to a safe computer. We'd suggest that this at your local library, a friend's house, an internet cafe or your workplace. This site also works on smartphones, so you may be able to browse on a phone borrowed from a friend.

If you think you might be at abuse due to someone discovering you have visited this website you should start to use someone else's computer/smartphone if that is possible.

How you protect your safety depends on how technically capable people around you are.

Measures you can take include:

* using a hidden browser window 
	* 	inPrivate (Internet Explorer), 
	*  private browsing (Firefox)
	*  incognito (Chrome)
* deleting your visit to this site from your browsing history

You might also want to make sure that your email and any social media accounts aren't set to automatically log you in. You may wish to set up a new, secret email address.

However the most technically capable people will be able to track anything on a computer that they have administrator access to. You should try to use a safer computer if at all possible.
