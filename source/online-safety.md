If you're worried that someone might discover you've visited this website, we'd recommend using a computer in a safer environment, such as at your local library, a friend's house, an internet cafe or your workplace. This site also works on smartphones, so you may be able to visit on a phone borrowed from a friend.

How well protected you are depends on how technically capable people around you are. The most technically capable people will be able to track anything on a computer that they have administrator access to. 

Safety measures you can take include:

* using a hidden browser window 
	* 	inPrivate (Internet Explorer), 
	*  private browsing (Firefox)
	*  incognito (Chrome)
* deleting your visit to this site from your browsing history

You might also want to make sure that your email and any social media accounts aren't set to automatically log you in. You may wish to set up a new, secret email address.
